In this exercise you will create a program that reads a letter of the alphabet from the user.
If the user enters a, e, i, o or u then your program should display a message indicating that
the entered letter is a vowel.
If the user enters y then your program should display a message indicating that
sometimes y is a vowel, and sometimes y is a consonant.
Otherwise your program should display a message indicating that the letter is a consonant.
