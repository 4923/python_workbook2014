# Exercise 53: Assessing Employees

'''
Write a program that reads a rating from the user
and indicates whether the performance was unacceptable, acceptable or meritorious.
The amount of the employeeâ€™s raise should also be reported.
Your program should display an appropriate error message
if an invalid rating is entered.
'''

rate = float(input("Input the rate: "))
perfomance = {0.0:"Unacceptable", 0.4:"Acceptable", 0.6:"Meritorious"}
if 0.6 < rate:
  rate = 0.6

raised_salary = 2400 * rate
print(f"Your perfomance was {perfomance[rate]}, your salary raised to {raised_salary}")
